##CodeBook for data created for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## download
Files are downloaded and unzipped as described in README.md

##dataset total_data
subject_test.txt (subjects), y_test.txt (activities) and X_test.txt (measurments) will be read into R (with command 
"read.table", default settings). All files have the same rowcount and are columnbinded. 

Same for subject_train.txt, y_train.txt and X_train.txt

The two resulting datasets are rowbinded (total_data)

The file features.txt contains the columnames for the measurments. Only names with "mean()" or "std()" will be used. 
Names with only "mean" are not avarages of measurments: variables with "meanFreq" are Weighted average 
of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency, variables with "gravityMean" are angles between two vectors. So for the resulting dataset, 
I only use variables with "mean()" and "std()". 

#dataset "dat"
The resulting dataset "dat" is a copy op "total_data" without the measurments other than the mean and std as just descibed.
features.txt is used for the (measurments) variable names. The tokens '(',')','-' wil be removed and names are set to lowercase. 
The first column of "dat" is calls "subject", the second "activities".
The file activity_labels.txt contains the activitylabels for "activities" and will be merges with "dat". Column 82 column is now created and called "activitylabel" 

features_info.txt contains more info about the measurements.

##aggregate
The averages of the measurments (mean) in "dat" (column 3 to 81) dataset "dat" are calculated by subject and activitylabel.
The averaged measurment names will be preceded by "avg". 
The resulting dataset is exported to meanofmeasures.txt
